README for Money::ChangeMaker

			    Money::ChangeMaker

Money::ChangeMaker is an OO module used to make change for a monetary
transaction.

PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I've only used it under Perl 5.6.1, so for
anything lower, you're on your own.

Money::ChangeMaker doesn't use any nonstandard modules.  In fact, it doesn't use
any modules at all.

INSTALLATION

You install Money::ChangeMaker as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Money::ChangeMaker in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in ChangeMaker.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.
